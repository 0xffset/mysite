    <p>My childhood was very normal. I still remember when I had my Nintendo64 buy, it got unhelpful after a while. So that I tried to fix but just found the problem when I was 12 years. There is a book that changes my world perspective called Cálculos Superiores en Química Física by Avery Shaw, and I said I do not die without knowing something about this book :). This book I did never return to primary school in 8th grade.</p>
<p>Throughout Polytechnic Institute, I started to learn about software and computers, learning HTML, CSS, C#, and C++. I learned Linux by myself, that it took me to erase the windows disk accidentally in the installation process, trying to create a dual-boot. But, mistakes are part of the learning process. Then, I started to download tons of books about Linux to get acquainted with the OS of my life Ubuntu and ArchLinux.</p>
<p>I’ve participated in many competitions like mathematics and literature (both two twice). The second time that I participated in the Regional Mathematics Olympics I was between the ten finalists and in the Regional Literature Olympics 4th position.</p>
<p>When I was 18 years old, I got my first job in Software Engineering. That job was very difficult for me, not in the sense of programming stuff…, but I don’t have free time in my daily activities to read something, just one lapse of 1 hour to lunch, from 8 AM to 6 PM. I completed the day very tired and incapable of doing something after that hour.</p>
<p>Now I love to code (every day I need it done, on the contrary, my day feels incomplete).</p>
<p>Currently, I do an MSc in Computer Science and Mathematics.</p>
